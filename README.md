# Employee Attendance & Payroll Analysis System

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini SQL project simulates a real-time **Employee Attendance and Payroll Analysis System** used in companies to manage employee records, attendance tracking, and salary analysis.

The project is built using **only SQL fundamentals**, making it ideal for beginners and freshers in Data Analytics or SQL development.

- Department-wise employee count
- Average salary by department
- Employees with high salaries
- Attendance summary (Present vs Absent)

---

## 🔐 Transaction Control
Used TCL commands to:
- Prevent accidental deletions
- Maintain data consistency
- Demonstrate real production-like safety mechanisms

---

## 💼 Real-World Relevance
